    "I believe this question is interesting because I was able to calibrate this camera using only this image and some basic knowledge of geography. It was the first time I used the ECEF world coordinate system for a camera calibration setting. Usually the pictures taken for calibration are of a small scene where world coordinate points are easy to declare, but here I had to give a lot of thought on how I can locate the points in the world frame until I had thought of the ECEF frame. This was mainly because I had never seen such problem before. The final results gave me the intrensics of the camera and expected location of the the satelite."

These days most of such functions are available through libraries but its still imporant to know such algorithms which run in real time and give accurate and efficient results, specially if your works revolves around it."

    "Since the application shows face filter from live camera feed, we need an algorithm that will perform face detection in real time with good accuracy. I'll use the Voila-Jones algorithm for face detection. It has low inference times and good accuracy. It is so efficient that many phone face unlock systems use this algorithm. Apple was using this till 2015 and Snapchat still uses this algorithm till today."

    "Generally in any face detection algorithm, to detect face from a given image, we use windows of different scales and pass them over the image. For each window location, we calculate a set of feature vectors and compare this set of feature vectors with other feature vectors which have a face in it and determine if the window position currently contains a face. To consider all possible scales, for an image of size 1024x1024, we usually use windows of sizes starting from 24x24 uptil 1024x1024, with approximately a 1.25 times scale change between successive window sizes. This gives about 17 filter sizes in total. Evaluating all these windows over the image at different positions requires calculating different features at all possible locations. This makes the task computationally expensive."

    "Voila and Jones introduced the concept of integral images which made the task of calculating features for a window significantly faster. Integral images can be generated from the original image where each pixel has a value equal to the sum of the values of all pixels above it and to its left. This calculation of integral image is only a one time task, after we have calculated it we can increase speed of feature extraction as follows:  \n",
    "S(i,j,x,y) = S(0,0,x,y) - S(0,0,i-1,y) - S(0,0,x,j-1) + S(0,0,i-1,j-1)  \n",

    "Another important thing that Voila and Jones observed was that generally there are about 10 to 15 windows that contain faces in majority cases so it would be ineffecient to evaluate all features for all windows. Instead the features should be evaluated in such an order so that features which have high true negative rate should be evaluated first and then features with increasingly higher true positive rate should be evaluated. Using this method we reduce the rate of false positive and greatly increase the accuracy. This speeds up the algorithms greatly as not much time is spent on windows which dont have face in them.   \n",
